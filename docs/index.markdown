Hi! I am a second-year PhD student at MIT, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv). I am broadly interested in cryptography and quantum information.

Previously, I worked as a quantitative research analyst at Citadel Securities, and before that I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at Princeton University in 2021. See my [CV](CV.markdown) for more information.
